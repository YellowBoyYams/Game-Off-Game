### How is the Check List Structured?

The check list is structured by what the most important things goes on the top and the least important things go on the bottom.

### Movement

In this release I got movement working and I also have animation working with a test spritesheet(Found in the assets folder).

You can move using the W(Up), A(Left), S(Down), D(Right) keys and you can also move using the arrow keys Up Arrow(Up), Down Arrow(Down), Left Arrow(Left), Right Arrow(Right) and finally for all of the vim users you can also move using J(Down), K(Up), H(Left), L(Right).

TLDR;


| Direction | Keyboard Key |    Arrow    | Vim Key |
| :---------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :-------: |
|    Up    |      W      |  Up Arrow  |    J    |
|   Down   |      S      | Down Arrow |    K    |
|   Left   |      A      | Left Arrow |    H    |
|   Right   |      D      | Right Arrow |    L    |

### Summary

As you can tell from the check list it appears that I have not got much done, but please keep in mind this is the first update, it is a school night and it is currently 10:30pm and I need some sleep. I hope you enjoy this game(barely any).
